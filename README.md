# Karkhana_io
This project implements a Python script to model a Mobius strip using parametric equations, compute its surface area and edge length numerically, and visualize the 3D structure. The implementation is modular, clearly structured, and makes use of standard scientific libraries including NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
